graphviz (2.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * As of 2.12-5 (and 2.16-1), the bindings should be mostly OK. The python
    one still has to be worked on to support all available python versions and
    that is still on the TODO list (see debian/TODO in the source package, or
    graphviz's TODO.Debian).
  * The diffimg binary isn't shipped since I don't really see how it belongs
    to the graphviz package. Nevertheless, if you feel you need it and it
    would be useful to you, just report a bug, and I'll include it.

graphviz (2.12-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Several bindings have been added with this upload (guile, lua, ocaml,
    php5, python, ruby). Besides the working ones (guile, perl, php, python,
    ruby, tcl), the status of the others is:
     - lua  : segfaults at loading.
     - ocaml: not tested, due to the lack of documentation for this one
              (no synopsis).
  * Any hint on how to test/debug/fix them is very welcome. They are shipped
    anyway in order to avoid too many NEW rounds, and to give users a chance
    to help the maintainer. ;-)
  * Binding manpages are available as gv_$lang.3, with appropriate information
    to use them under debian.
  * Java and C# bindings (#360970 and #360977) are not planned at the moment,
    given the restrictions on the architectures on which they are available.
    Anyway, any tested patch is welcome to add them.
  * More information about outstanding work is available in the TODO.Debian
    file.
