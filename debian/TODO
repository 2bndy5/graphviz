TODO for graphviz
-----------------

  * Check whether we should ship *.la files. According to libpkg-guide, we
    could replace them with pkgconfig only, but let's not make too many changes
    at the same time. Remaining .la files are in libgraphvizN-dev and libgv-tcl.
  * Sort out what's needed/wanted in the contrib directory and in examples.
  * Check the dependencies for all bindings, e.g. libgv-guile doesn't seem to
    depend on any guile package.
  * The handling of the libgv-php5 package could be better. An idea would be to
    have a debian/libgv-php5.install.in file, which would be preprocessed, so
    that the appropriate path is computed at build-time (using the output of
    the “php-config5 --extension-dir” command).
  * That should really be done for all languages needing extra work,
    see debian/rules.
  * Think about putting the configuration file into /var, see the discussion
    with Alexander on the 10th of August.
  * Check the .0.0.0 stuff for the Tcl parts. Should it be using “-module
    -avoid-version” too? A Tcl/Tk policy is being worked on.
  * Improve the python bindings: the goal is to have them built for each
    available python version. An update of the long description of the
    libgv-python package will then be needed. An option is to use
    “make PYTHON_INCLUDES=-I/usr/include/python2.5” but it would be cleaner to
    handle the files directly in the Makefile, so as to ensure autotools stuff
    does the whole job.
  * Eventually cherry-pick php fixes from CVS, as suggested by John Ellson in
    <47446D5F.10803@research.att.com>.
  * Stop using -lstdc++ and use CXX (not trivial actually).
  * Adjust --build and --host options to ./configure so as to support cross-
    compilation correctly.
  * The Conflicts between libgv-perl and older graphviz might go away since the
    location of perl files was adapted to follow the perl policy. To be checked
    with piuparts.
