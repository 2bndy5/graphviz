<A NAME=ID>In the formats: -Tcmap, -Tcmapx, -Tsvg, -Tvml, the output generates
'id="\\N"' properties for nodes and html-cells, 'id="\\E"' properties for edges, and 'id="\\G"' properties for clusters. Then it applies the usual "\\X" substitutions on these strings.

The 'id="xxx"' property is intended to be a predictable string that uniquely identifies the graph object.  This 'id' can be used from Javascript, for example.

At the moment the edge id doesn't distinguish between multiedges in 
non-strict graphs.
