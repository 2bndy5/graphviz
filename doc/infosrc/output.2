<A NAME=ID>In the formats: -Tcmap, -Tcmapx, -Tsvg, -Tvml, the output generates
'id="node#"' properties for nodes, 'id="edge#"' properties for edges, and 'id="cluster#"' properties for clusters, with the '#' replaced by an internally assigned integer. These strings can be provided instead by an externally provided "id=xxx" attribute on the object.
Normal "\N" "\E" "\G" substitutions are applied.
Externally provided id values are not used internally, and it is the use's reponsibilty to ensure
that they are sufficiently unique for their intended downstream use.
Note, in particular, that "\E" is not a unique id for multiedges.
