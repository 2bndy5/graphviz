<A NAME=ID>In the formats: -Tcmap, -Tcmapx, -Tsvg, -Tvml, the output generates
'id="node#"' properties for nodes, 'id="edge#"' properties for edges, and 'id="cluster#"' properties for clusters, with the '#' replaced by an internally assigned integer. These strings can be provided instead by an "id=xxx" attribute on the object.
Externally provided id values are not used internally, but it is the users reponsibilty to ensure
that they are sufficiently unique for any downstream use.
